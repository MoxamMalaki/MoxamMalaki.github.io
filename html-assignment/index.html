        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>HI, my name is Malaki the reason that i joined <abbr title="Interactive Midea Design">IMD</abbr> Is because before this course I was working in construction  and that was just not me i've always been more of an artistic guy and be stuck is that kinda of enivornment was not fun but hey it pay good at least  </p>
        <p>Prosonally my favorite class so far has to be coding I have found it <b>very</b> rewarding, since the class is full of valuable imformation every week.
        One website that i've started using in my spare time, called <em>Free code Camp</em> ive found it has made the classes just a bit easier to follow along. </p>
